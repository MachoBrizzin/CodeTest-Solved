# CodeTest Solved
<h3>Code Test for Edge-Sweets</h3>

<span>This was solved by creating a 2D grid and interating so long as there was enough room on either axis to fit a shape.</span>

<span>The first shape is spawned at 0,0 + the spacing/padding. Then the program evaluates how many spaces/units in the grid on either axis the shape would need if it were to be created. We then subtract the position index of the previous shape from the total dimension of the grid on that axis. If we have sufficient space for a new shape and its spacings, we add it, otherwise, we don't. The image below compares Edge-Sweets' populated grid with my own (as seen in the Unity engine).</span><br />

<span>The first shape should go in the bottom-left corner, as so: </span><br />

<br /><span>Note: You will also be given spacing between squares</span>

<span>Determine how many shapes can fit inside the large rectangle, and set their starting points where they need to be, like so: </span><br />

The code test is the backend logic that would determine how to do the above example. There are sample shapes in the code test to work with. You should:

1. Determine how many shapes can fit.
2. Return a list of shapes complete with their starting points
3. Confirm that your method works for any variety of shape.

Information you're given:
1. Size of the square
2. Spacing between squares
3. Size of the sheet to fill in

Notes:
- Assume shapes will be "rectangular". That is, no overlapping of shapes need to occur.
- Spacing includes spacing from the sides of the rectangle
- Bottom-left corner is 0,0
- Not all parts will fit exactly in the rectangle. Side spacing is minimum required spacing


Example:
   
    Shape fiveUnitRectangle = CreateFiveUnitRectangle(); //this creates the shape. This will be done by us.

    //TestModel takes in spacing, shape coordinates (list generated by us), and sheet size
    TestModel test1 = new TestModel(1, fiveUnitRectangle, new Size(50, 50));
    List<Shape> placedShapes1 = GetInsertedShapePositions(test1); //main call to call into your code. This returns a list of shapes in their proper positions

test1 correct output: 

<i>Note</i> Numbering can also be incremented opposite way (x incrementing first, then y)
